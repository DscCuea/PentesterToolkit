# Pentest Docker Step-By-Step Toolkit

A specially prepared image for `Cybersecurity Full Roadmap 2022` talk, that can help you to practice penetration testing skills of an application inside a Docker container. 

## Why should you use this toolkit?
- The objective of this toolkit is to provide pentesters, security researchers and bug bounty hunters with a pre-configured environment that has some of the most popular tools and frameworks already installed and configured.
- This toolkit offers a multiplatform base to work with as the script can be installed on Linux, setup with Docker or installed on Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem For Linux).
- The installer script can be customized to add or remove specific tools based on your requirements.
- Tools are constantly being added, updated and fixed.
- In addition to the tools that are already installed, you can use the Katoolin script to install additional tools that you may require during your engagements.
